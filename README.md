# pomodoro

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method to improve your productivity.
It is used to divide the time into intervals called session and breaks.

The length of each interval depends on your level of focus which is usually 25 minutes for session and 5 minutes for breaks.

The pomodoro timer is a great technique to use when you want to stay focus on an activity to meet a goal.
